              <p>
                Stack Your Gold isn’t just a business—it’s a passion born from necessity. Our ownership team is made up of two families coming together to educate and build a better future.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the lessons we want to pass on to the next generation, including our own combined 10 children. Financial education often comes too late. Many of us weren’t taught how to build wealth, preserve purchasing power, or think long-term about our financial future.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our goal is to make precious metals accessible to everyone, regardless of income level or experience. We are committed to giving everyone access to physical bullion through flexible purchasing options and affordable subscription programs. 
              </p>
              <p>
                To ensure every order builds a real micro-stack, we utilize grain-weight options to fill order gaps that others leave open, making the most of every dollar you invest.
              </p>

                Wealth isn’t built overnight. It’s built overtime, consistently.
